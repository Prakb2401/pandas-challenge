### Pandas-Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used Python, Pandas, and jupyter notebook to analyze and clean two datasets. I started wtih PyCitySchools where I cleaned and analyzed a csv dataset about district school information. I found total budget for each school in the district, I found age demographics of each school, and I found which schools have highest scores based on size, budget, and school type. Then I worked on HereosOfPymoli where i analyzed and cleaned a csv dataset about players in a game. I found total amount of plaers and item purchasing anlysis. I found gender demographics anf purchasing analysis based on gender. I did the same for age and then i found top spenders and the most popular items.
